#### What I'm working on

Since finishing my web developer bootcamp with [neuefische](https://www.neuefische.de/en?gclid=Cj0KCQjwrsGCBhD1ARIsALILBYprKu2OoxTOm6WIC1fruI4Sow6QQ3fWdLT_uK_pXXSQi6vXCp0ICB8aAqq5EALw_wcB) 🐠 last year, I spent my days developing new and expanding my existing programming skills. <br>

I am currently working as a freelance web developer for 3d Ninjas. We are creating an ecommerce platform and technical pipeline for interop between DCC tools for artists, creators and developers. 

The tech stack I'm working mostly with right now is **React**, **TypeScript** and **Vue.js** in the frontend and **express.js** in the backend.
